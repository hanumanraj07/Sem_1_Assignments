  <h1>History of Computers and the Internet</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The history of computing began with <b>mechanical devices</b> like the abacus. 
    Charles Babbage designed the <u>Analytical Engine</u>, which is considered the 
    <strong>first concept of a programmable computer</strong>. 
    Ada Lovelace wrote the first algorithm, showing how machines could handle symbols, 
    not just numbers. These early steps prepared the way for the digital age.

  <h2>Early Computers</h2>
  <p>
    The <mark>first generation</mark> of computers used vacuum tubes. 
    These machines were very large and consumed huge amounts of electricity. 
    Later, <i>transistors</i> replaced tubes and made systems smaller and more reliable. 
    This was followed by <em>integrated circuits</em> in the third generation.

  <h2>Generations & Technical Terms</h2>
  <p>
    The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> is the brain of the computer. 
    It moved from simple circuits to powerful microprocessors over time. 
    Programming also evolved, with <code>C</code> and <code>FORTRAN</code> 
    making coding easier. 
    A famous formula is E = mc<sup>2</sup>, while H<sub>2</sub>O shows how 
    <var>subscripts</var> are used.

  <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
  <p>
    The Internet started with ARPANET, a research network. 
    Tim Berners-Lee later introduced the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, 
    making information easy to share. 
    Email and file transfer soon became everyday tools. 
    The web quickly changed how people learned and communicated.

  <blockquote>
    "The power of the Web is in its universality. 
    Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." 
    â€“ <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>

  <h2>Modern Era</h2>
  <p>
    Connections shifted from <del>dial-up</del> to <ins>broadband</ins> and fiber. 
    Today, computers fit in <small>pockets as smartphones</small>. 
    Apps, cloud services, and AI shape daily life. 
    Security and privacy are now major concerns.
  </p>

  <h2>Computer Code Example</h2>
  <p>
    A simple <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page can be written like this:
  </p>

  <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

  <p>
    Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text. 
    A system might respond: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Computers and the Internet grew from simple machines to global networks. 
    Understanding both <strong>history</strong> and <em>technology</em> 
    helps us prepare for the future. 
    With AI and faster networks, the next chapters are still being written.
